    9.  A function that is the property of an object is called method.
    10. To access the variable of an object from inside the method we need to use 'this' or

        known as instane variables or properties.

    Object is defined in a single way, but can have different structure internally.
        i.      let user = {
                    name : 'Rohit
                };

        ii.     let user = {
                    name : 'Rohit',
                    sayHi: function(){
                        console.log('Hello');
                    }
                };

        iii.    let user = {
                    name : 'Rohit',
                    sayHi(){
                        console.log('Hello');
                    }
                };

        iv.     let user = {
                    name : 'Rohit',
                    sayHi: function sayHi(){
                        console.log('Hello');
                    }
                };
                user.sayHi(); //Hello

        v.     let user = {
                    name : 'Rohit'
                };
                function sayHi(){
                    console.log('Hello');
                }
                user.sayHi = sayHi;
                user.sayHi(); //Hello

        vi.     let user = {
                    name : 'Rohit'
                };
                var sayIt = function sayHi(){
                    console.log('Hello');
                };
                user.sayHi = sayIt;
                user.sayHi(); //Hello

        vii.    let user = {
                    name : 'Rohit'
                };
                var sayIt = function(){
                    console.log('Hello');
                };
                user.sayHi = sayIt;
